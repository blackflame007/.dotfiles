"""VECTOR's skills: know-how he loads on demand, from the one shared directory
~/.config/bromigos/skills/ (dotfiles linux/.config/bromigos/skills/).

A skill is a Markdown file with YAML frontmatter (name, description, when_to_use), either
flat (`<name>.md`, as the live layer's skills are written) or Agent-Skills style
(`<name>/SKILL.md`). Each becomes a deferred Pydantic AI capability: the model sees the
name and description in its catalog and loads the body with `load_capability` when a task
needs it. The catalog is re-read when the directory changes (signature()), so a new or
edited skill is live on the next question.
